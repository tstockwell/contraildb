<h1>A Java Virtual Machine for Automatically Parallelizing Java</h1>
This package implements a tiny Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that can load and 
execute standard Java class files.
However, this virtual machine, the Plazma Virtual Machine (PVM), automatically parallelizes
Java using a method that is very similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">Actor-based concurrency</a>.
Plazma automatically parallelizes Java in the following way...
<li>Every method call is executed in its own lightweight thread, called a continuation.<li>
<li>Every method call immediately returns a <b>Future</b>.  
 A Future represents the result of an asynchronous computation. 
 A Future has methods to check if the computation is complete, to wait for its 
 completion, and to retrieve the result of the computation.
 <p>
 All references to the original value returned from a method call are essentially 
 replaced with a call to Future.get(). 
 </p>
</li>
<li>When a call is made to Future.get() and the result of the associated method 
is not yet available then execution of the current continuation is suspended until 
the associated method completes.
</li>
